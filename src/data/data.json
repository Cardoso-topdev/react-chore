    "paragraph": "When our son Marc was about 4 years old, he wanted a toy car from a store. We told him we didn’t have cash with us, and he protested, but you can use your credit card!”. We wondered, how we were going to teach him the value of money and the responsibility that comes with it? \nWe did the piggy bank, 3 jars, allowance, chore lists, you name it! but, it was always a hassle to get him to understand, that to get what he wants, he needs to work for it. \n And so this idea was born. Create an experience where he feels we trust him enough to give him spending money and the only way he will be able to get more is by paying it back with chores. \n No more asking for money, no more allowance, no more fighting to get him to do chores. \n Now he is 10 and wants the new Beats, and he knows what he needs to do to get it."
