  {
    title:`How Do We Work with Other Services and Platforms?`,
    content:`A significant benefit and innovation of Use Chore’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third- party account or
    platform. 
    
    For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a non-Chore account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own. 
    
    When you authorize such a connection, Chore and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly. Examples of account connections include:
    
    • linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;

    • connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials; or

    • using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.
    
    If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service.
     
    For example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection. 
    
    If you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases. 
    
    We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.  
    
    Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices. 
    
    Before authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any thirdparty that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection. 
    
    For example, Personal Data that Chore shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.`

Subscription Services may subject you to recurring fees and/or terms. By signing up for a Subscription Service, including after any free trial period, you agree to pay us the subscription fee and any applicable taxes as set forth in your Chore Account settings or as otherwise agreed in writing (“Subscription Fee”).

Paid Service Fees may be paid by debit card, credit card, or deducted from your linked bank account. If you link a debit or credit card to your account, you authorize us to collect Paid Service Fees by debit from your linked debit card or charge to your linked credit card. Regardless of payment device, we reserve the right to collect Paid Service Fees by deduction from your linked bank account.
Unless otherwise provided in a Subscription Service’s terms, Subscription Fees will be charged on the 1st of every month until cancelled. You may cancel a Subscription Service at any time from your Chore Account settings. If you cancel a Subscription Service, you will continue to have access to that Subscription Service through the end of your then current billing period, but you will not be entitled to a refund or credit for any Subscription Fee already due or paid. We reserve the right to change our Subscription Fee upon thirty (30) days’ advance notice. Your continued use of Subscription Services after notice of a change to our Subscription Fee will constitute your agreement to such changes.

No Warranties
THE USE OF Chore IN THIS SECTIONS AND Limitations of Liability and Damages MEANS Chore, ITS PROCESSORS, ITS SUPPLIERS, AND ITS LICENSORS (AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES).
THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER IT IS EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, Chore SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
Chore DOES NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICES ARE ACCURATE, RELIABLE OR CORRECT; THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION, UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, WITHOUT DEFECT OR SECURE; THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE SERVICES ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.
Chore does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any product or services advertised or offered by a third party. Chore does not have control of, or liability for, goods or services that are paid for using the Services.
Limitations of Liability and Damages
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL Chore BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, INABILITY TO USE, OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICE. IN ALL CASES, Chore WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL Chore BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS, OR INJURY RESULTING FROM HACKING, TAMPERING, OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF THE SERVICES OR YOUR Chore Account, OR THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF Chore IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT OF FEES EARNED BY US IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES DURING THE THREE (3) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM FOR LIABILITY, OR (B) $500.
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF Chore HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.

Third Party Products
All third party hardware and other products included or sold with the Services are provided solely according to the warranty and other terms specified by the manufacturer, who is solely responsible for service and support for its product. For service, support, or warranty assistance, you should contact the manufacturer directly. Chore MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Disputes
“Disputes” are defined as any claim, controversy, or dispute between you and Chore, its processors, suppliers or licensors (or their respective affiliates, agents, directors or employees), including any claims relating in any way to these General Terms, any Additional Terms, or the Services, or any other aspect of our relationship.

Binding Individual Arbitration
You and Chore agree to arbitrate any and all Disputes by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE GENERAL TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST Chore. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration). All Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association according to this Section and the applicable arbitration rules for that forum. Consumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family, or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in their local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as their matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class or non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies. If you are a consumer bringing a claim relating to personal, household, or family use, any arbitration hearing will occur within the county where you reside. Otherwise, any arbitration hearing will occur in New York County, New York, or another mutually agreeable location. The arbitrator’s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. We will pay the arbitration fees due to the American Arbitration Association for individual arbitrations brought in accordance with this section. If you prevail on any claim for which you are legally entitled to attorney’s fees, you may seek to recover those fees from the arbitrator. For any claim where you are seeking relief, we will not seek to have you pay our attorney’s fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and Chore also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the Services. Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases) will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in state court in New York County, New York, or federal court for the Southern District of New York.

Governing Law
These General Terms and any Dispute will be governed by New York law and/or applicable federal law (including the Federal Arbitration Act) as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within New York, without regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles.

Limitation on Time to Initiate a Dispute
Any action or proceeding by you relating to any Dispute must commence within 90 days after the cause of action accrues.

Assignment
These General Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you and any attempted transfer or assignment will be null and void.

Third Party Services and Links to Other Web Sites
You may be offered services, products and promotions provided by third parties and not by Chore (“Third Party Services”). If you decide to use Third Party Services you will be responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions for these services. We are not responsible for the performance of any Third Party Services. The Services may contain links to third party websites. The inclusion of any website link does not imply an approval, endorsement, or recommendation by Chore. Such third party websites are not governed by these General Terms. You access any such website at your own risk. We expressly disclaim any liability for these websites. When you use a link to go from the Services to a third party website, our Chore Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on a third party website, including those that have a link in the Services is subject to that website’s own terms, rules and policies.
Force Majeure
Chore shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.

Notice
You are responsible for providing Chore with your most current email address. In the event that the last email address you provided to Chore is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering you notices required/permitted under these Terms, Chore's dispatch of the email containing such notice will constitute effective notice. You may give notice to Chore via email at support@usechore.com.   Such notice shall be deemed to be given when received and acknowledged by Chore via email.

Other Provisions
These General Terms, and any applicable Additional Terms or Policies, are a complete statement of the agreement between you and Chore regarding the Services. In the event of a conflict between these General Terms and any other Chore agreement or Policy, these General Terms will prevail and control the subject matter of such conflict. If any provision of these General Terms or any Additional Term is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. These General Terms do not limit any rights that we may have under trade secret, copyright, patent, or other laws. No waiver of any term of these General Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.

Payment Services
Chore  offers Payment Services that allow you to authorize the purchase of goods and services online. We are not a bank and do not offer banking services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury. You must open a Chore Account before accessing the Payment Services.

Your Authorization
In connection with the Payment Services, you authorize us to act as your agent for the limited purposes of making payments on your behalf. Your authorization permits us to generate virtual payment cards (“Virtual Cards”) for every transaction that you authorize. Your authorizations will remain in full force and effect until you close a Virtual Card or your Chore Account is closed or terminated.
Virtual Cards are not issued to you and are not for consumer use. They are issued to Chore  and are used exclusively by Chore  to make payments on your behalf. You cannot use Virtual Cards in any way beyond their intended purpose.

Our Role
When you Chore's browser extension or mobile application to transact, Chore  will create a unique card number issued to Chore , load it with funds and make the purchase. Chore  is the cardholder in this transaction.

Using the Service to Authorize Payments
For security and fraud protection, there is an initial limit on the dollar amount you can authorize in a transaction and there is an initial limit on the total dollar amount you can authorize over a period of time. The maximum amount initially allowable for authorization is $1,000 per weekly period and $3,000 per calendar month. The per week and per calendar month limits are subject to increase or decrease at our discretion based on an algorithmic review process and a manual review process.

Bank Transfer Authorization
You authorize the Company to initiate electronic transfers (via the Automated Clearing House ("ACH") of NACHA - The Electronic Payment Association ("NACHA")) from your bank account on record of account of up to your Daily Limit on a daily basis. You agree that ACH transactions you authorize comply with all applicable law.
When your checking account is used as your funding source for a transaction, you are requesting that we initiate on your behalf an electronic transfer from your bank account. You agree that such requests constitute your authorization to Company to make the ACH transfer, and once you have provided your authorization for the transfer, you will not be able to cancel the electronic transfer and Company may resubmit any ACH debit you authorized that is returned for insufficient or uncollected funds, except as otherwise provided by NACHA's ACH rules, or applicable law.

Transaction Fees
The following fees are assessed when we settle a transaction to your funding source.



Conversion to US Dollars
Transactions made in currencies other than U.S. Dollars will be converted by the network or card association that processes the transaction into U.S. Dollars. The card association may consider transactions occurring in U.S. territories to be an international transaction. Conversion to U.S. Dollars may occur on a date other than the date of the transaction, thus the actual conversion rate may differ from the rate in effect at the time of the transaction. You agree to pay the converted amount plus any applicable conversion charges made by the network or card association that processes the transaction.

Chore Account Registration for Payment Services
You must open a Chore Account to access Payment Services. In order to use Payment Services, you must be at least 18 years old. You confirm that you are either a legal resident of the United States, a United States citizen or a business entity authorized to conduct business by the state(s) in which you operate and that you are an authorized signatory for the business you represent. You must use yours or your business’ true and accurate name when opening a Chore Account.

Underwriting and Identity Verification
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires us to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who requests to use Payment Services.
What this means for you: When you open a Chore Account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth and other information that will allow us to identify you.
We may make inquiries that we consider appropriate and use third party services to help us verify your identity and determine if we should open, maintain, collect or close your account. We may also report the status, history and/or closure of your account to third-party services.
If you allow someone else to use your Chore Account, you are responsible and liable for all transactions, withdrawals, deposits and fees that arise out of such use.

Requests for Additional Information and Inspection
Chore  may request additional information from you at any time. For example, Chore  may ask you to present a government issued identification such as a passport or driver’s license, a business license, or other information. If you refuse any of these requests, your Chore Account may be suspended or terminated.

Adding a Funding Source
Payments made by Chore  on your behalf are settled to an authorized funding source. In order to Chore's Payment Services, you must first add an eligible funding source to your Chore Account via the Chore  mobile app. By connecting a funding source, you are pre-authorized recurring transfers by Chore from that funding source.
If you add a funding source to your Chore Account, you agree that:
You are the owner of the funding source;
You are authorized to transfer funds from that funding source; and
You authorize us to initiate debits from your funding source according to your instructions.
Any authorizations to debit a funding source will remain in full force and effect until you cancel the authorization by removing the funding source. You can remove a funding source on the Chore  website. If you cancel your authorization, you will give us enough time to act on your cancellation. By entering your funding source information on the Chore  site, you have signed this ACH authorization and you should print and save a copy of it.

Payment
Each time a payment is made by Chore  on your behalf, the amount of the transaction will be settled from your designated funding source. If Chore  is not able to settle a transaction with your account, your Chore Account may be suspended.

Availability of Payment Services
We may restrict your access to Payment Services if we need to conduct an investigation or resolve any pending dispute related to your use of the Payment Services. We may also restrict access to Payment Services as necessary to comply with applicable law or court order, or if requested by any governmental entity.

Chore Account History
When a payment is made on your behalf we will update your Chore Account activity on the website and provide you a transaction confirmation. The confirmation will serve as your receipt. Summaries of your Chore Account activity, including monthly statements, are available on our website for up to one year of account activity. Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for (a) compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your Chore Account and your use of the Payment Services, and (b) reconciling all transactional information that is associated with your Chore Account. If you believe that there is an error or unauthorized transaction activity is associated with your Chore Account, you must contact us immediately.

Processing Errors
We will attempt to fix processing errors we discover. If the error resulted in your payment of an amount larger than what you authorize we will transfer the difference to your linked bank account. If the error resulted in your payment of an amount less than what you authorized Chore  will debit the extra funds from your linked bank account. We will only correct transactions that are processed incorrectly if you notify us with (1) your name and Chore Account information, (2) A description of the error or transaction and why you believe it is an error or why you need more information and (3) the dollar amount of the suspected error. Please notify us of such an error by calling 844-771-8229 or writing to us at (Marc Barnes Corp., 148 Lafayette St, Fl 3, NY, NY 10013) as soon as possible. Your failure to notify us of a processing error within sixty (60) days of when it first appears on your electronic transaction history will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.

Payment Dispute Resolution Procedure
You agree to comply with our Payment Dispute Procedure for any payments in relation to any Payment Services provided by Chore .

1: Open a dispute case within ninety (90) days of the date of the transaction in question email at support@usechore.com. Depending on your claim (item not received or refund not received), we may ask you to wait 10 business days from the transaction date to proceed with the payment dispute.
2: Respond to our requests for other information.  Chore may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents depending on the situation.  You must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.
3: Comply with Chore's shipping requests in a timely manner, if you’re filing a Significantly Not as Described claim, we may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to us, or to a third party (specified by Chore) and to provide signature confirmation proof of delivery.
4: Chore will make a final decision on your claim, in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online payment dispute resolution process or any other information Chore deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.

Harm includes fraud and other criminal acts. If we suspect that your Chore Account has been used for an unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose, you give us express authorization to share information about you, your Chore Account, and any of your transactions with law enforcement and, as deemed necessary by Chore, our payment processing and financial institution partners.

Set Off
You acknowledge that, except as otherwise prohibited by law, Chore will have the right to charge or set off against your account any indebtedness or other obligations which you or any owner owe us, at any time, without any further notice to or demand on you, whether the indebtedness or other obligations exist at the time the account is opened or arise later. The indebtedness includes, without limitation, all charges incurred on any account you hold with Chore. You agree that Chore may set off against the account any claim which we have against you without regard to the source or ownership of the funds on deposit in the account and without requirement that the claim be owed to us by all of the account owners. You also agree that, to the extent allowed by law, Chore may set off any indebtedness or other obligations which you owe us under this Agreement against any other account or property in which you have an ownership interest that is in Chore's possession or control.



Bank Account Information and Authorized Actions

We work with one or more Third Party Services (as defined below) that will securely store pursuant to industry standards any Authorized Bank Account access credentials that you provide and will access your Authorized Bank Accounts for the purposes of providing and improving the Payment Services. You may only provide account access credentials for and authorize us to access valid accounts that you hold in your own name. You may not provide access credentials for an account that is held by a third person.
If you choose to provide your Authorized Bank Account credentials to us, you authorize us to use this information to provide you with the services we offer through the Payment Services.

Termination of Payment Services
Chore may Terminate your use of the Payment Services at any time for any reason. Any termination of these terms does not relieve you of obligations to pay Fees or costs accrued prior to the termination, Chargebacks, and any other amounts owed to us as provided in these Payment Terms or the Terms of Service. In the event your Chore Account has a negative balance, Chore reserves the right to withhold refunds or credits to settle the negative balance.
